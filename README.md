## Description
Dreadit is a social media app where horror, thriller, and chiller enthusiasts users can share and react to the latest spooky discoveries, adding other users to their friend (aka Ghoul) list. 

This is a full-stack MERN app using a GraphQL API and Apollo Server for CRUD database interaction. The front-end was developed with React and the back-end was developed with MongoDB, Mongoose, Express and Node.js. GraphQL queries and mutations were used for CRUD functionality.
